# Arduino-LED-Cube
The goal is to make an arduino-based 3D LED cube 8x8x8 which can produce different light patterns. The LED cube is made by using 512 LEDs arranged as cubical lattice. This LED cube can be used to give 3 dimensional light patterns. A microcontroller is used to produce the light patterns.
